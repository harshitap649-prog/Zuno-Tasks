## 🎯 TO MAKE IT LIVE NOW (Choose One):

### Method 1: Trigger Build in Netlify Dashboard (FASTEST - 30 seconds)

1. **Go to your Netlify project:**
   - Open: https://app.netlify.com/projects/zunotasks/overview

2. **Click "Deploys" tab** (top menu)

3. **Click "Trigger deploy"** button (top right)

4. **Select "Clear cache and deploy site"**

5. **Wait 2-3 minutes**

6. ✅ **YOUR SITE IS LIVE!** 🎉

### Method 2: Push to GitHub (Auto-Build)

**If your code is connected to GitHub:**

1. Open terminal in your project folder
2. Run these commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix build - ready for Netlify auto-deploy"
