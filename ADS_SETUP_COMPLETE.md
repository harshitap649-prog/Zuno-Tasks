## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Ads Not Showing?

1. **Did you restart the server?** → Must restart after adding `.env` file
2. **Check browser console** (F12) → Look for errors
3. **Verify `.env` file exists** in project root
4. **Check ad codes** in `.env` are correct (no extra quotes)

### Ads Showing But Not Loading?

1. **Wait a few minutes** → Adsterra needs time to initialize
2. **Check Adsterra dashboard** → Verify ad units are active
3. **Clear browser cache** → Ctrl+Shift+R
4. **Try different browser** → Test in Chrome/Firefox

### Specific Ad Not Working?

- **Banner Ad**: Check bottom of page (must be logged in)
- **Social Bar**: Click "Watch Ad" button (check daily limit)
- **Sidebar Ad**: Only shows on desktop, Dashboard page
- **Inline Ad**: Between content on Dashboard
