# 🔧 Lootably Connection Issue - Error 522

## ❌ Problem:
You're seeing a **"Connection timed out"** error (Error code 522) when trying to access `lootably.com`.

## 🔍 What This Means:
- **Error 522** = Cloudflare can't connect to Lootably's origin server
- This is a **server-side issue** on Lootably's end, not your website
- The server is either down, overloaded, or experiencing technical issues

## ✅ Solutions:

### Option 1: Try Again Later (Recommended)
- This is usually a **temporary server issue**
- Wait 10-30 minutes and try accessing `lootably.com` again
- Check if the site is back online

### Option 2: Use Alternative Platforms
Since Lootably is having server issues, you can use the other instant approval platforms:

1. **AdGem** ✅ (Available)
   - Website: https://www.adgem.com/publishers
   - Similar features to Lootably
   - Instant approval

2. **Hideout.tv** ✅ (Available)
   - Website: https://www.hideout.tv/publishers
   - Video-focused platform
   - Instant approval

3. **OfferToro** ✅ (Already configured)
   - Multiple task types
   - Reliable platform

4. **CPX Research** ✅ (Already configured)
   - High-paying surveys
   - Already working

### Option 3: Check Lootably Status
- Visit: https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/lootably.com.html
- Check if Lootably is down for everyone or just you
- Monitor their status page (if available)

## 📝 What to Do:
1. **Fix the syntax error** I just fixed in AdminPanel.jsx
2. **Configure AdGem and Hideout.tv** instead (they're working)
3. **Try Lootably again later** - it should come back online

## 💡 Recommendation:
Since you have **multiple instant approval platforms** now, configure **AdGem** and **Hideout.tv** first while Lootably is down. You can always add Lootably later when their server is back online.

The code is already integrated - you just need to:
1. Sign up for AdGem: https://www.adgem.com/publishers
2. Sign up for Hideout.tv: https://www.hideout.tv/publishers
3. Configure them in Admin Panel → Offers tab
