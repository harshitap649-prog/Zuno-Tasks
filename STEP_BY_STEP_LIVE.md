## 📋 STEP 1: Push Fresh Deployment

I've updated the version number to trigger a fresh deployment. 

### Run this command in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Keshav\Desktop\Zuno Tasks"
git add package.json vercel.json index.html
git commit -m "Trigger fresh deployment - v1.0.1"
git push origin main
```

**OR run the script:**
```powershell
.\redeploy-now.ps1
```

**Tell me "STEP 1 DONE" when you've pushed, then I'll give you Step 2.**
