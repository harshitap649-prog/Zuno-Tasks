# 🔧 Fix Build Error - Complete Solution

## Current Situation:
- ✅ Your latest commit `18b8c37` should work (has correct `index.html`)
- ❌ Commit `52150d8` failed (this was "Add files via upload")
- 🌐 Website is live but on old deployment `488351b`

## Problem:
The failed deployment (`52150d8`) might have incorrect files. We need to ensure the correct files are pushed.

## ✅ Solution: Verify and Push Clean Build

### STEP 1: Check Build Logs (Find the Error)

Go to Vercel Dashboard:
1. Click on the **FAILED deployment** (the red one - `DejNBki5o`)
2. Click **"Logs"** tab
3. Scroll to find the **error message** (usually in red)
4. **Copy the error** and share it with me

**OR** tell me "CHECK LOGS DONE" if you can't find it, and I'll provide Step 2.

---

### STEP 2: Force Clean Deployment (If Logs Don't Help)

I'll create a clean commit that will definitely work.

**Please do STEP 1 first - check the build logs and share the error message!**
