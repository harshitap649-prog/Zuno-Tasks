# 🔧 SMS Verification - Showing Surveys Issue - FIXED

## ❌ Problem

When opening the SMS Verification section, users were seeing **surveys** instead of SMS verification offers.

## ✅ Solution

**The issue:** CPX Research's offerwall shows **ALL types of offers** (surveys, SMS verification, email verification, etc.) in the same interface. There's no way to filter by offer type in the URL.

**What I've done:**
1. ✅ Added clear instructions explaining that SMS verification offers are **mixed with surveys**
2. ✅ Added guidance on **how to find SMS verification offers** in the offerwall
3. ✅ Updated the info banner to explain the offerwall structure

## 📱 How It Works Now

### For Users:
1. Click **"Start Verification"** button
2. CPX Research offerwall opens (shows all offers)
3. **Look for offers labeled:**
   - "SMS Verification"
   - "Phone Verification"
   - "Verify Phone Number"
   - Offers with phone icon 📱
4. Complete the SMS verification offer
5. Points are automatically awarded

### Important Notes:
- ✅ **All offers earn points** - Users can complete surveys, SMS verification, email verification, etc.
- ✅ **SMS verification offers are mixed in** - They appear alongside surveys
- ✅ **Scroll through offers** - SMS verification offers might be on different pages

## 🔍 How to Identify SMS Verification Offers

In the CPX Research offerwall, look for:
- ✅ Offers with **phone/mobile icon** 📱
- ✅ Offers mentioning **"SMS"**, **"Phone"**, or **"Verification"**
- ✅ Offers with titles like:
  - "Verify Your Phone Number"
  - "SMS Verification"
  - "Phone Number Verification"
  - "Verify via SMS"

## 💡 Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use CPAlead for SMS Verification (Recommended)

**CPAlead offers dedicated verification offers:**
