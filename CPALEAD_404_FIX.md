# 🔧 CPAlead 404 Error - How to Fix

## ❌ Problem: Getting 404 Error from CPAlead

You're seeing a 404 error when trying to open the CPAlead offerwall. **This is NOT because your website is on localhost!**

The 404 error is coming from **CPAlead's server** (`cpalead.com`), which means the URL format we're using might not be correct, or you need to create a Content Locker first.

---

## ✅ Solution: Create Content Locker in CPAlead Dashboard

### **Why This Happens:**

CPAlead doesn't automatically provide an offerwall URL. You need to:
1. **Create a Content Locker** in your CPAlead dashboard
2. **Get the integration URL** from CPAlead
3. **Use that exact URL** (which may be different from what we guessed)

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Fix

### **Step 1: Go to CPAlead Dashboard**

1. Visit: https://cpalead.com/publisher/
2. Log in with your account

### **Step 2: Find "Reward Tools" or "Content Lockers"**

Look in the left sidebar for:
- **"Reward Tools"**
- **"Content Lockers"**
- **"Tools"**
- **"Integration"**

Click on it.

### **Step 3: Create a New Content Locker**

1. Click **"Create New Locker"** or **"New Content Locker"**
2. Configure it:
   - Name: "Zuno Tasks Offerwall" (or your choice)
   - Type: Select "Offerwall" or "Content Locker"
   - Save/Submit

### **Step 4: Get Integration URL/Code**

1. After creating, CPAlead will show you:
   - Integration code (HTML/JavaScript)
   - OR a direct URL to use
   - OR embed instructions

2. **Copy the URL** they provide (it might look like):
   - `https://cpalead.com/locker.php?pub=3310355&sub=USER_ID`
   - `https://cpalead.com/content-locker?id=XXXXX`
   - Or a different format

### **Step 5: Update the Code**

Once you have the correct URL format from CPAlead:

1. **Check the URL format:**
   - What does it look like?
   - Does it use `?pub=` and `?sub=` parameters?
   - Does it have a different structure?

2. **Share the URL format with me:**
   - Tell me the exact URL structure CPAlead provides
   - I'll update the code to use the correct format

## 🔍 Alternative: Check CPAlead Documentation

1. Go to CPAlead Help/Support section
2. Look for "Integration Guide" or "Content Locker Setup"
3. Find the correct URL format for your account type

## 💡 Important Notes

### **About Localhost:**

- **Localhost is NOT the issue** - The 404 is from CPAlead's server
- The URL goes directly to `cpalead.com`, so your local server doesn't matter
- Even on a live website, you'd get the same 404 if the URL format is wrong

### **What We Need:**

We need the **exact integration URL** that CPAlead provides in their dashboard. Once you have it, I can update the code to use the correct format.
