# 🚀 Make Website Live - Step by Step

## Current Status:
- ✅ Deployment `488351b` is "Ready" and marked as "Current"
- ❌ Newer deployment `52150d8` failed
- 🌐 Website should be live at: https://zuno-tasks-kg4t.vercel.app

## Fix Steps:

### STEP 1: Verify Everything is Correct Locally
Your `index.html` is correct ✅

### STEP 2: Force Redeploy on Vercel
We'll trigger a new deployment to ensure the site is live with the latest correct code.

## 🔧 Solution: Redeploy with Correct Code

I'll create a small change to trigger a fresh deployment that will succeed.
