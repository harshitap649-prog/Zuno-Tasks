## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Single Configuration**: You only need to configure the Offerwall Direct Link URL once. Both banner ads and watch ad function use the same URL.

2. **No Additional Setup**: Once you configure the Offerwall URL, both features work automatically. No separate configuration needed.

3. **URL Format**: Make sure you're using the **Direct Link** URL, not the embed code or widget code.

4. **User Tracking**: The system automatically appends user IDs to track conversions, so CPALead can credit your account properly.
