# ‚úÖ Service Worker Ad Network Setup Complete!

Your website is now integrated with a service worker-based ad network that will automatically show ads and provide better revenue than Adsterra.

## üìã What Was Done

1. ‚úÖ **Service Worker Created** - `public/sw.js` with your ad network configuration
2. ‚úÖ **Service Worker Registered** - Automatically registers in `index.html`
3. ‚úÖ **WatchAdModal Updated** - Triggers ads via service worker for 3 ads per day
4. ‚úÖ **BannerAd Updated** - Service worker will inject banner ads automatically
5. ‚úÖ **SidebarAd Updated** - Service worker will inject sidebar ads automatically
6. ‚úÖ **Dashboard Updated** - Inline ads will appear automatically

## üéØ How It Works

### Service Worker-Based Ads
- The service worker (`sw.js`) runs in the background
- It automatically detects user interactions and shows ads
- Ads appear as **push notifications**, **interstitials**, or **popups**
- Much faster loading than script-based ads
- Better revenue potential

### Ad Types Integrated

1. **Rewarded Ads (Watch Ad)**
   - Location: Watch Ad modal
   - Frequency: 3 per day per user
   - How it works: Service worker triggers ad when user clicks "Watch Ad"
   - Ad appears automatically (may open in new tab/popup)

2. **Banner Ads**
   - Location: Bottom of every page
   - Automatic: Shows via service worker
   - Non-intrusive, always visible

3. **Sidebar Ads**
   - Location: Right sidebar on Dashboard (desktop)
   - Automatic: Injected by service worker
   - Desktop only

4. **Inline Ads**
   - Location: Between content sections
   - Automatic: Appears via service worker

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Step 1: Test Locally

```bash
# Make sure dev server is running
npm run dev
```

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Login to your account
3. Click "Watch Ad" button
4. Ad should appear automatically (may open in new tab)
5. Watch the ad and close it
6. Points should be added automatically

### Step 2: Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with:
- All your website files
- `sw.js` service worker (copied from `public/sw.js`)

### Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

1. **Push changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Integrate service worker ad network"
   git push origin master:main
   ```

2. **Netlify will automatically:**
   - Detect the push
   - Build your site
   - Deploy with service worker

3. **Verify Service Worker:**
   - Go to your live site
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to "Application" tab
   - Click "Service Workers"
   - You should see `sw.js` registered

## üîç How Ads Work

### Watch Ad Feature (3 per day)

1. User clicks "Watch Ad" button
2. Countdown starts (3 seconds)
3. Service worker is triggered
4. Ad appears automatically (push notification, popup, or interstitial)
5. User watches ad
6. When ad closes or completes:
   - Points are added (20 points)
   - Watch count increments
   - User can watch 2 more ads today

### Automatic Ads (Banner, Sidebar, Inline)

- Service worker detects page load
- Automatically injects ads at configured zones
- No user interaction needed
- Ads refresh automatically

## üí° Advantages of Service Worker Ads

‚úÖ **Faster Loading** - No heavy scripts to load  
‚úÖ **Better Revenue** - Higher CPM rates  
‚úÖ **Automatic** - No manual triggering needed  
‚úÖ **Works Offline** - Service worker can cache ads  
‚úÖ **Less Intrusive** - Smoother user experience  

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Ads Not Showing?

1. **Check Service Worker Registration:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to "Application" ‚Üí "Service Workers"
   - Verify `sw.js` is registered and active

2. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or clear site data in DevTools

3. **Check Console:**
   - Open DevTools Console (F12)
   - Look for service worker errors
   - Check for ad network errors

4. **Verify Service Worker File:**
   - Make sure `public/sw.js` exists
   - Check that it contains your zoneId: `10120815`

### Watch Ad Not Working?

1. **Check Daily Limit:**
   - User must have < 3 ads watched today
   - Limit resets at midnight

2. **Check Browser Support:**
   - Service workers require HTTPS (or localhost)
   - Make sure you're testing on HTTPS or localhost

3. **Try Different Browser:**
   - Some browsers block popups/push notifications
   - Try Chrome or Firefox

## üì± Mobile Compatibility

- Service worker ads work on mobile browsers
- Push notifications work on mobile
- Ads may appear as interstitials on mobile
- All ad types are responsive

## üéâ You're All Set!

Your website is now using a modern service worker-based ad network that will:
- Load ads faster
