Hello Adsterra Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to request assistance with my popunder ad unit. I would like to disable adult ads for my popunder ad unit, but I am unable to edit the "Adult ads" toggle in my dashboard.

**My Ad Unit Details:**
- Ad Unit ID: 27903083
- Ad Unit Name: Popunder_1
- Format: Popunder
- Current Status: Adult ads are enabled

**What I Need:**
I would like to either:
1. Disable adult ads for my existing popunder ad unit (ID: 27903083), OR
2. Create a new popunder ad unit with adult ads disabled from the start

**Why:**
I want to serve non-adult ads to my website visitors, but I cannot edit the adult ads setting in my dashboard.

Could you please help me with this request? I would greatly appreciate your assistance.

Thank you for your time and support.

   - They'll provide you with a new code
   - Share the new code URL with me
   - I'll update your code automatically

## 🆘 Still Need Help?

If Adsterra support doesn't respond or can't help:
- I can help you switch to a different ad network (PropellerAds, PopAds, etc.)
- Or help you create a new ad unit manually if the dashboard allows it

Let me know how it goes!
