# How to Earn Money Through Captcha System

## The Middleman Model - How It Works:

### Step 1: Get Clients
Clients need captchas solved. They pay you to solve them.

**Example Clients:**
- Websites that need captcha solving
- Apps that need verification
- Services that use captcha solving

**How to Get Clients:**
1. Advertise your service (social media, forums)
2. Offer competitive pricing
3. Show fast solving times
4. Build reputation

### Step 2: Set Your Pricing
Configure in Admin Panel → Captchas Tab → Settings:

**You Charge Clients:**
- Example: ₹0.50 per captcha solved
- Or: ₹5 per 10 captchas
- Or: Custom pricing based on volume

**You Pay Users:**
- Example: ₹0.10 per captcha (10 points)
- Configure in: Admin Panel → Offers Tab → Captcha Settings
- Set points per captcha (e.g., 1 point = ₹0.01)

**Your Profit:**
- ₹0.50 (charge client) - ₹0.10 (pay user) = ₹0.40 profit per captcha

### Step 3: Revenue Calculation

**Example Scenario:**
- 100 users solve 10 captchas/day each
- 100 × 10 = 1,000 captchas/day
- Your profit: 1,000 × ₹0.40 = ₹400/day
- Monthly: ₹400 × 30 = ₹12,000/month

**With More Users:**
- 500 users × 10 captchas = 5,000/day
- Profit: 5,000 × ₹0.40 = ₹2,000/day
- Monthly: ₹60,000/month

### Step 4: How Money Flows

```
Client → Pays You ₹0.50 → You Store Captcha
                              ↓
User → Solves Captcha → Gets ₹0.10 (10 points)
                              ↓
Client → Gets Solution → Pays You ✅
You → Keep ₹0.40 Profit
```

## Setting Up Pricing:

### In Admin Panel:
1. Go to **Admin Panel → Offers Tab**
2. Click **"Captcha Settings"**
3. Set **Points Per Solved Captcha** (e.g., 10 points = ₹0.10)
4. Save

### Example Pricing Strategy:

**Tier 1: Low Volume (1-100 captchas/day)**
- Charge client: ₹0.50 per captcha
- Pay user: ₹0.10 (10 points)
- Your profit: ₹0.40 per captcha

**Tier 2: Medium Volume (100-1000/day)**
- Charge client: ₹0.45 per captcha
- Pay user: ₹0.08 (8 points)
- Your profit: ₹0.37 per captcha

**Tier 3: High Volume (1000+ captchas/day)**
- Charge client: ₹0.40 per captcha
- Pay user: ₹0.05 (5 points)
- Your profit: ₹0.35 per captcha
